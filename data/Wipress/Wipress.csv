WIPRESS,http://www.wipltd.in/images/bird_eye.jpg,"WIPRESS, a hard and rigid board having high purity with excellent electrical and mechanical properties, is specifically produced for the high voltage and extra high voltage Transformer Industry. The product is made from imported virgin softwood sulphate pulp in our new production line using 'state of art technology'. Our experience over four decades in producing fibre boards and densified wood guarantees product compliance to lEC 60641 B.3.1 grade pressboard. Separate conditioning and testing facilities have been established for uninterrupted and speedy testing and evaluation of the raw materials and the product.","Pre compressed pressboards are cellulose based and are produced from kraft unbleached softwood pulp having high chemical purity and low conductivity. They are produced on intermittent board machine and compacted without added bonding agents in multi day-light press under heat and pressure to achieve required properties. The boards are characterized by high density, high purity, uniform thickness, dimensional stability, low compressibility, low shrinkage and high electrical strength. Pre compressed pressboards have high dielectric strength and find use as insulating material in different types of Power and Distribution Transformers, Capacitors, Switch Gears etc., in the form of winding cylinders, spacers, washers, keyway strips. etc. <strong>Water : </strong>Quality Water is the most critical factor in the manufacture of Pressboard. Kerala, particularly Cannanore receiving more than 3000 mm of rainfall every year has an abundant resource of excellent quality water available throughout the year. This water is further treated by a most modern Water Treatment Plant. <strong>Hydraulic Press :</strong> A most modern multiday-light Hydraulic Press of 1200 tonnes capacity of size 2.2 x 1.1 meters with Thermic Fluid Heating is used for the manufacture of Pre compressed Pressboards.
