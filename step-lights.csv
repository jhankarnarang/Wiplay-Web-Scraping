FinOptic-LBLF (G657A1) has excellent bending performance and also result in lower attenuation in challenging applications & it is optimised for use in Fibre To The Home (FTTH) operations. FinOptic-LBLF meets or exceeds ITU Recommendations G657(Category A), IEC 60793-2-50(TypeB1.3)FinOptic-NZDSF fibre is designed to operate across a window of wavelengths near 1550nm with small amount of dispersion. FinOptic-NZDSF fibre is optimized for use in national long haul backbone networks. Due to its lower dispersion in the 1550nm window it is an ideal and cost effective solution for DWDM operations. FinOptic-NZDSF meets or exceeds ITU Recommendations G655. LBLF NZDSF  LWPF LWPF PREMIUM  ']"
